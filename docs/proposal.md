#####Introduction

In the early 1980's, Richard Feynman observed that certain quantum mechanical effects could not be efficiently simulated using classical computation methods. This led to the proposal for the idea of a "quantum computer", a computer that uses the effects of quantum mechanics, such as superposition and entanglement, to its advantage. Until recently, the field of quantum computing remained in infancy. In 1994, Peter Shor (Bell Labs) developed a quantum algorithm to factor integers in polynomial time, providing motivation and renewed interest in building quantum computers and discovering other quantum algorithms.
