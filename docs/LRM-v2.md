####Introduction

This is the language reference manual for Quark, a high level language for quantum computing. Quark makes it simple to perform complicated mathematical operations required for quantum computing in a simple and intuitive manner. In addition to standard types featured in most common programming languages, Quark supports complex numbers, fractions, matrices and quantum registers.

####Grammar Notation

####Lexical Conventions
A program in QUARK includes at least one function definition, though something trivial like a variable declaration or a string should compile. Programs are written using a basic source character set accepted by the C++ compiler in use. Refer to what source-code file encoding your compiler accepts.

####Line Terminators
?

####Comments
MATLAB style commenting is supported. A MATLAB style comment begins with `%` and ends with `%`. Multi-line MATLAB comments start with `%{` and end with `}%`. Any sequence of characters can appear inside of a comment except the string `}%`. These comments do not nest. 

####Whitespace
Whitespace is defined as the ASCII space, horizontal tab and form feed characters, as well as line terminators and comments.

####Tokens
Tokens in QUARK consist of identifiers, keywords, constants, and separators. Whitespace is ignored and not taken into consideration.

####Identifiers
An identifier is composed of a sequence of letters and digits, the first of which must be a letter. There is no limit on the length of an identifier. The underscore character `_` is included in the regular expression pattern for letters. 

```
digit -> ['0'-'9']
letter -> ['a'-'z' 'A'-'Z' '_']
Identifier -> letter (letter | digit)* 
```
