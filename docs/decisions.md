Decisions
==========
This is a log of all project decisions we make.
- 9/8/14:
    1. Formed team of Parthiban Loganathan, Jim Fan, Daria Jung and Jamis Johnson.
- 9/9/14: 
    1. Agreed on quantum computing language. Jim has experience in quantum computing and built a simulator in C++ that we will use in our project.
    2. Created GitHub organization and repository.
- 9/10/14:
    1. Went over basic pre-requisite knowledge of quantum computing inlcuding qubits, superposition, quantum entanglement, quantum registers, Hadamard gates, etc. Decided to demo Shor's and Grover's algorithm.
    2. Set up Vagrant for common dev environment and Trello for project management and SCRUM board.
- 9/11/14:
    1. Started maintaining log of all project decisions.
- 9/15/14:
    1. Consulted Prof. Edwards on using external simulator and designing a quantum computing language.
    2. Decided on demos: Shor's factorization algorithm, Grover's search algorithm, possibly Deautsch-Jozsa simulation and Simon's period algorithm time permitting.
- 9/17/14:
    1. Decided on supporting integers, floats, strings, complex numbers, matrices, quantum registers and gates as built-in types.
    2. Considered making the language dynamically typed.
    3. Assigned team roles. Parthi - Manager, Jim - System Architect, Daria - Verification & Validation, Jamis - Language Guru.
- 9/21/14:
  1. Jim and Jamis swapped roles.
  2. Decided on language syntax and started drafting proposal.
